# gen-pwtech
Password generator that can be self configured


Simply add portable version of pwtech (make sure to not overwrite the ini unless you wish to design your own profiles)

INI file assumes the path C:\Programs\PwTech\


Change the Profile variable in genpass.ps1 to use a differently designed profile built in the pwtech gui. (two different profiles are included)


The script copies the password straight to the clipboard.


createShortcut.bat places a shortcut on the user desktop and sets the custom icon.


You can then pin to taskbar and if you move it to the left most position you can pop a password to clipboard by pressing WIN+1
